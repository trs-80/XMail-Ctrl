=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module allows for access to the Crtl functions for XMail.
It operates over TCP/IP. It can be used to communicate with either
Windows or Linux based XMail based servers.

The code was written on a Win32 machine and has been tested on
Mandrake and Red Hat Linux as well with Perl version 5.6 and 5.8

As of version 2.0 all code is written on under a Linux platform
using Perl 5.8.  It has been tested on:
- Mandrake 9.0 with Perl 5.8 by Aaron Johnson
- Mandrake 8.2 with Perl 5.6.1 by Aaron Johnson
- ActiveState Perl (5.8) on Windows by Thomas Loo

Version 2.0 and higher require Digest::MD5, all passwords are
now sent as an MD5 value.

=head2 Overview

All commands take the same arguments as outlined in the XMail
(http://www.xmailserver.com) documentation.  All commands are
processed by name and arguments can be sent in the any order.

Example command from manual (is one line):
"useradd"[TAB]"domain"[TAB]"username"[TAB]"password"[TAB]"usertype"<CR><LF>

This turns into:

    $xmail->useradd( {
        domain => "domain.com",
        username => "username",
        password => "password",
        usertype => "U"
        }
        );

You can put the four parts in any order, they are put in the
correct order by the modules internals.

The command structure for XMail allows a fairly easy interface
to the command set.  This module has NO hardcoded xmail methods.
As long as the current ordering of commands is followed in the
XMail core the module should work to any new commands unchanged.

Any command that accepts vars can be used
by doing the following:

To send uservarsset (user.tab) add a vars anonymous hash,
such as:

    $xmail->uservarsset( {
    domain   => 'aopen.hank.net',
    username => 'rick',
    vars     => {
        RealName      => 'Willey FooFoo',
        RemoteAddress => '300.000.000.3',
        VillageGrid   => '45678934'
        }
    } );

The ".|rm" command can used as described in the XMail docs.

If you are having problems you might want to turn on debugging
(new in 1.5)

    $xmail->debug(1);

to help you track down the cause.

Setting the debug level to 4 will provide a very complete
output of the communication between the server and your
program. A line starting with >> (incoming) indicates what the Ctrl
service sent back and << (outgoing) indicates what the XMail::Ctrl
sent to the server.

All commands return a 1 if successful and undef on failure.

=head2 Lists

Lists are now (as of 1.3) returned as an array reference unless
you set the raw_list method to true.

    $xmail->raw_list(1);

To print the lists you can use a loop like this:

    my $list = $xmail->userlist( { domain => 'yourdomin.net' } );
    foreach my $row (@{$list}) {
    print join("\t",@{$row}) . "\n";
    }

Refer to the XMail documentation for each command for information
on which columns will be returned for a particular command.

You can send a noop (keeps the connection alive) with:

    $xmail->noop();

As of version 1.5 you can perform any froz command:

    $froz = $xmail->frozlist();

    foreach my $frozinfo (@{$froz}) {
        s/\"//g foreach @{$frozinfo};
        $res = $xmail->frozdel( {
                        lev0 => "$frozinfo->[1]",
                        lev1 => "$frozinfo->[2]" || '0',
                        msgfile => "$frozinfo->[0]",
                        });
        print $res , "\n";
    }

=head1 BUGS

Possible problems dealing with wild card requests.  I have
not tested this fully.  Please send information on what you
are attempting if you feel the module is not providing the
correct function.

=head1 THANKS

Thanks to Davide Libenzi for a sane mail server with
an incredibly consistent interface for external control.

Thanks to Mark-Jason Dominus for his wonderful classes at
the 2000 Perl University in Atlanta, GA where the power of
AUTOLOAD was revealed to me.

Thanks to my Dad for buying that TRS-80 in 1981 and getting
me addicted to computers.

Thanks to my wife for leaving me alone while I write my code
:^)

Thanks to Oscar Sosa for spotting the lack of support for
editing the 'tab' files

Thanks to Thomas Loo for making many major refactoring
contributions for version 2.0 as well as providing better
debugging output.
